The Galileo 2 Extruder (G2E) is designed as a drop-in replacement for Voron printers utilizing the Stealthburner toolhead.  G2E features a custom large drive gear (16mm diameter) mated to an idler bearing to help prevent extruder artifacting due to gear meshing, and because it features a planetary gearbox, there's no issue with gear meshing vibrations/noise found with improperly adjusted CW2 extruders.
